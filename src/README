This package contains Linux man pages in Czech.

Much is missing - contributions are welcome. Mail them to
tropikhajma@gmail.com.
The latest release can be found at 
http://sweb.cz/tropikhajma/man-pages-cs/index.html

All the pages are now in utf-8 format and separated by package of origin. 
It may be necessary to recode them to ISO-8859-2 in some distributions.
Man pages from the package man-pages-cs-0.16 are included.

Copyrights: These man pages come under various copyrights. All are freely
distributable when the nroff source is included.

NOTE: The Makefile script uses Debian-specific man syntax for the check part.
Will not work with classic man 1.6.

#NOTE!!! This version is the first after the start of OmegaT transition.
#Filename structure has changed, the md5sum schema has been abandoned
#(mostly due to changes in the english man-pages). The Makefile and
#scripts are BROKEN. I need you to fix this - thanks in advance!
